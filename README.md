Entailment and Contradiction Detection with Pytorch

This repository contains a notebook for the [Kaggle "Contradictory, My Dear Watson" learners' competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/contradictory-my-dear-watson/data), focused on Natural Language Inferencing; a subfield of Natural Language Processing.
Here I use Pandas and Seaborn for data exploration, and Pytorch and Pytorch-Lightning for modeling.
