# EntailmentContradictionPytorch

This repository contains a notebook for the Kaggle "Contradictory, My Dear Watson" learners' competition, focused on Natural Language Inferencing; a subfield of Natural Language Processing.
Here I use Pandas and Seaborn for data exploration, and Pytorch and Pytorch-Lightning for modeling.
